# PartyCross Unity Project


## Game Description
A multiplayer game that allows multiple players to control a single character.

##### Objective
  The objective of the game is to navigate across the busy roads without dying.  Depending on 
the game mode selected, users will play Single Player or Co-op.  If playing single player your score 
will increase based on the number of moves completed before Game Over.  If playing Co-op, your movement acts as 
a vote.  If the majority choose the same direction, the move will be executed and individual and team score 
will increase.  If a vote results in a stalemate, no movement or points will be awarded.

##### Menu Navigation
New Game - Start a new Single Player game.

New Co-op Game - Start a new Co-op Game.

Credits - Displays the developer team information.

Online Play - This is the final resting place of our implemented server code.  It contains the options to 
Host Game, Join Server or Return to the main menu.  The buttons will activate the server code, but alas 
it remains functionless at the moment.
